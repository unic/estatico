# Estático

**DEPRECATED**: We have moved on to https://github.com/unic/estatico-nou, which is more modular and "standards-based".

Static site generator for frontend unicorns. 

Estático has been born as a result of a collective work of our frontend team. We use it in our daily work for rapid creation of clean, modern, maintainable static websites.

NOTE: A more modular and faster version is being developed in https://github.com/unic/estatico-nou
